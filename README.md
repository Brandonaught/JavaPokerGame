The player places an initial bet between one (1) and fifty (50) coins, where each coin is worth $1.00. The player is then dealt five (5) cards and allowed to choose which cards, if any, they wish to keep. The cards that they do not wish to keep are discarded, and replacement cards are dealt so that they again have a total of five (5) cards. The computer then determines what amount they have won, if any.
When you are dealt replacement cards for your discards, your new hand is evaluated. Based on what kind of hand you're holding, you'll receive a certain number of coins.

Hands are listed below, from best (highest scoring), to worst (no score):

Royal Flush - 400 coins
A straight flush, with the Ace high.

In other words, a Ten, Jack, Queen, King and Ace, all of the same suit.

Straight Flush - 50 coins
A straight flush.

In other words, all five cards are consecutive and are the same suit.

For example: Three of Clubs, Four of Clubs, Five of Clubs, Six of Clubs and Seven of Clubs.

Four of a Kind - 25 coins
Four cards of the same value. (Obviously, each of different suits.)

Full House - 8 coins
A three of a kind and a pair at the same time.

Flush -  5 points
All cards in your hand are the same suit.

Straight - 4 coins
All five cards are consecutive.

For example: Three of Clubs, Four of Spades, Five of Clubs, Six of Diamonds, and Seven of Hearts.

Three of a Kind - 3 coins
Three cards of the same value.

Two Pair - 2 coins
Two pairs of cards.

In other words, two cards in your hand are the same value, and two other cards in your hand are also the same value.

Pair - 1 coins
Two cards in your hand are the same value. In this version, they must be Jacks or better!

None of the Above - 0 coins
Each turn "costs" at least one coin to play, so if you get a pair, no additional coins are actually added to your total score. If you don't get anything, you actually lose the number of coins that you bet! If you bet more than one coin, then the returns above are multiplied by the number of coins entered to give the actual yield.
